THEME 3 - NIOS has all the resources parents need to homeschool their children.

But their UI is not at all intuitive. There is no easy-to-follow guide. It is not supplemented with other free resources from around the Internet

Transform it and other such guides into a step-by-step roadmap for a parent to homeschool their kid successfully.




## How will we solve the problem
- After looking at the problem statement we felt that, we can improve the UI and make it easy to use in an interative way by making a cross platform App for it(which would work on any devices from web to android and IOS ).

- We have make the website as per the topic listed in Hack to Educate. We have to focus on the real problem on the topic, for making better UI easy to implementing for Parents and Student as well.
- This is an Elearning website that after creating an account will let you learn different subject.
- we will arrange all the feature of details in a proper manner that a parent and student can easily go through.

## What will be your final demo?

- In Our Website, On the top of menu bar we have mention About, Department/Unit, Learner Corner, Notification, Related link , Contact us option are mentioned in menu bar.
- Just below after menu bar The important links are provided for academic purpose, in which we have mentioned online cource materials, examination/Result, Study center , Admission, Digital librarary for better improvement of student.
- At the left corner we have a menu name (information about) which include several option like admission Eservice notice board, tender notice, Vacancy.
- At the right corner we have a animation type video that will guide the new parents or student to how to use the website that helps the person to reach their demand easily.

This project is an E-learning platform developed by Nidhal Abidi and Oussama Aouini as a summer project .
We used for the front end : html , css , javascript and bootstrap (a framework) .
for the back end we used : php and databases .

In order for this website to work properly you need to  ( we will run it locally ): 
1) Install a software that will run the php code : we propose WAMP or XAMPP 

2)Run WAMP or XAMPP

3) Set the database necessary for the sign in / sign up system to work properly and to be able to change the profile picture within this website : 
	a/Open your browser ( we recommand opera for minimum bugs that you may face )
	b/Type localhost/phpmyadmin/ then for the username : root 
				                  password : (leave it empty )
then click on "go" 

 4)click on "Databases" ( Bases de donn√©es )  then write inside the Database Name : "loginsystemtut" then click on "create"

5)click on the "SQL" tab up top and then write this SQL code to create the first table :
  CREATE TABLE users (
idUsers int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
uidUsers TINYTEXT NOT NULL,
emailUsers TINYTEXT NOT NULL,
pwdUsers LONGTEXT NOT NULL
);

6) click "go" or "execute" 

7) Now we need to create the second table :
	a)click on "loginsystemtut" (which is the name of our database )
	b)click on the SQL tab up top and then write this SQL code to create the second table : 
	CREATE TABLE imgupload (
	id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	userid int(11) NOT NULL,
	status int(11) NOT NULL
	);

8) click "go" or "execute" 

9)Everything is set up inside the database , now copy the folder named "e-learning" and go inside the installation folder of the software "wamp" then the folder "www" then paste it there .

10)Now open any browser you want and write "localhost/e-learning" and click enter to use it .

Note : 
The steps above are only followed when you try to use the website for the first time  ( because we need to set the database ) otherwise you ignore them and do these two steps : 

1)Run the software "WAMP" or "XAMPP"

2)open any browser you want and write "localhost/e-learning" and click enter to use the website
